# easycommons-util
A fork of the easycommons-util library
Originally sourced from: svn:https://svn.petalslink.org/svnroot/tags/easycommons-util-2.6.1

The structure of the original project with enforcement rules in a deep-parent made certain changes difficult. 
Therefore the parent build directives have been brought directly into the project and certain checks have been overridden.
